# CryptoZombies_inClass
Repository to hold activites completed in Solidity for Blockchain & Applications course.  
## Contract.sol  
* In this program, we created a function that takes a name, uses it to generate a random zombie, and adds that zombie to our app's zombie database on the blockchain.
## zombiefactory.sol & zombiefeeding.sol   
* We make the game multi-player, and we also implement a different way to create zombie using cryptokitties.
